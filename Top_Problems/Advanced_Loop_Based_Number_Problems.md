Example: **9 → Binary=1001 → Two 1s → Evil ✅**

---

## 10. Buzz Number (Google, Infosys)
👉 A number is Buzz if it ends with 7 OR is divisible by 7.  
Example: **27 → Ends with 7 → Buzz ✅**

---

👉 A number that is product of two consecutive integers.  
Example: **12 → 3×4 → Pronic ✅**

---

## 12. Sunny Number (Amazon, Wipro)
👉 A number n is Sunny if (n+1) is a perfect square.  
Example: **8 → (8+1=9=3²) → Sunny ✅**

---

## 13. Trimorphic Number (Amazon, TCS)
👉 A number whose cube ends with the number itself.  
Example: **4 → 4³=64 → Ends with 4 → Trimorphic ✅**  
Example: **24 → 24³=13824 → Ends with 24 → Trimorphic ✅**

---

## 14. Keith Number (Microsoft)
👉 A number that appears in a sequence where each next term = sum of previous digits.  
Example: **197 → 1,9,7,17,33,57,107,197 → Keith ✅**

---

## 15. Automorphic in Power (Google DeepMind)
👉 A number that is automorphic not just in square but also in cube.  
Example: **376 → 376²=141376 → Ends with 376 ✅**  
Example: **376³=531766976 → Ends with 376 ✅**

# ⚡ Advanced Loop-Only Problems (Hard Level)

## 1. Krishnamurthy Number (Advanced Strong Number)
👉 A number whose sum of factorial of digits = number.  
Example: **145 → 1!+4!+5! = 145 ✅**

---

## 2. Special Number (Range Check)
👉 Variation: Check in a range (1–100000) how many such numbers exist.  

---

## 3. Peterson Number
👉 Similar to Strong Numbers, check if sum of factorial of digits = number.  

---

## 4. Emirp Number (Amazon)
👉 A number that is prime, and its reverse is also prime.  
Example: **13 → Reverse 31 → Both prime ✅**

---

## 5. Cyclic Number (Google)
👉 A number whose cyclic rotations are multiples of itself.  
Example: **142857 → (×2=285714, ×3=428571 … rotation property ✅)**

---

## 6. Self Number (Google Japan)
👉 A number that cannot be generated by n + sum(digits(n)).  
Example: **20 is not self (15+1+5=21), 21 is not self… tricky loop.**

---

## 7. Lychrel Number Check (Google Research)
👉 Reverse + add until palindrome appears. If never → suspected Lychrel.
